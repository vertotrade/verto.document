## How can I stake VERTO?

You can stake your VERTO in VertoTrade Pools. Visit the [Pools page](https://vertotrade.com/pools).

Read our [How to Stake in Pools guide](https://docs.vertotrade.com/products/pools/res-pool-guide) if you'd like a hand getting started with staking.

## What is the difference between staking and farming?

Staking in Pools and farming with Yield Farming are both ways to earn more VERTO by supporting VertoTrade.

Staking only needs some VERTO to be added to a Res Pools to earn VERTO or other tokens.\

Farming is more complicated and needs LP Tokens to earn VERTO.\

## Is VertoTrade protected from flashloan attacks?

VertoTrade's vault has anti-flashloan protection. VertoTrade’s VERTO token isn’t vulnerable to flash loan attacks. Unlike vulnerable tokens, VERTO token minting is predefined, and can’t be adjusted in a single transaction. Ownership cannot be transferred outside of OptimusMercator contract.

VertoTrade’s other smart contracts, like IFO and AutoPool, are protected as well; they prevent other contracts from interacting with them, reducing the scope of vector attacks.
