# Controlling VERTO supply

## Does VERTO have a hard cap?

Yes, VERTO now has a hard cap of 750M as outlined in our litepaper [https://v2litepaper.vertotrade.finance/](https://v2litepaper.vertotrade.finance/)

## How VERTO supply is reduced

The mercators aim to **make deflation higher than emission** by building deflationary mechanisms into VertoTrade's products. The goal is for more VERTO to leave circulation than the amount of VERTO that's produced.

### Reducing block emissions

By reducing the amount of VERTO made per block, we slow inflation. This has already been done once: Since the [first reduction in block emissions](https://vertotrade.com/voting/proposal/bafkreide2rtzqmwezritljamjswp63si4gpt2i7fo7sxf7p64sjinhhoy4), we've already effectively reduced the number of VERTO entering circulation from 40 VERTO per block to 11.16. But we don't want to do this too frequently, too early, we want to still incentivize people to provide liquidity.

### Deflationary mechanisms

Regular token burns ([view burn address](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)) are built into many of VertoTrade's products (like a 20% burn of VERTO spent on lottery tickets), with more on the way. Check the [**VERTO Tokenomics page**](https://docs.vertotrade.com/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics) for details on present and upcoming deflationary mechanisms.
