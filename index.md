# VertoTrade Intro

{% hint style="success" %}
**VertoTrade helps you make the most out of your crypto in two ways:**

**Trade, and Earn.**
{% endhint %}

## ↔️ Trade

> Instantly swap crypto tokens: no registration or account needed.

### The people's choice

VertoTrade is the official decentralized exchange on [Rebuschain](https://www.rebuschain.com).

### Low fees

Why pay more? VertoTrade runs on Rebuschain, a blockchain with much lower transaction costs than Ethereum or Bitcoin.\
Trading fees are lower than other top decentralized exchanges too, so that's a double win for you!

### Decentralized

Trade directly from your wallet app.\
Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, VertoTrade doesn’t hold your funds when you trade: **you have 100% ownership of your own crypto**.

## 💸 Earn

> Earn VERTO and other tokens for free with super high interest rates.

### Earn tokens with Pools

Stake REBUS or VERTO, earn free tokens. It’s really that easy.
REBUS and VERTO holders earn free tokens each week from major projects. New projects join the party frequently, so you can earn more, for even longer.

### Earn VERTO with Yield Farms

Stake LP tokens, earn VERTO. You take on a little more exposure to market fluctuations than with the Pools, but can earn higher APR to offset the risk.

### Earn Trading Fees

No farm? No problem. Even if your trading pair isn’t supported on the Farms page, you can still earn trading fees when you stake your tokens in Liquidity Pools (LPs).

## Is VertoTrade safe?

VertoTrade was forked from Pancakeswap so the smart contract are just as safe. With that said we are currently having the smart contracts audited and once we have the result they will be published below.
