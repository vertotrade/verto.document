# vVERTO

### What is vVERTO?

vVERTO is a number representing the boosted voting power based on a userâ€™s fixed-term VERTO staking position.

The vVERTO number will be added to your total voting power.

**Similar to iVERTO, vVERTO is NOT a new token.**

vVERTO IS NOT transferrable or tradeable.

### How is vVERTO calculated?

vVERTO is calculated based on two variables:

1. The amount of VERTO located in the Fixed-Term Staking Pool
2. The remaining lock durations of the staking positions

For point 2., it is important to clarify that the remaining lock duration is not (a) how many weeks you committed your VERTO for when you first locked it up (e.g. 52 weeks), but (b) the time remaining on your lock. In this case, if you locked VERTO for 52 weeks around 10 weeks ago, your remaining lock duration is 42 weeks, not 52 weeks.

If your remaining staking duration is less than one week, your vVERTO is equal to the amount of VERTO locked in the VERTO pool.

If your remaining staking duration is more than one week, your vVERTO is equal to the amount of VERTO locked, multiplied by the number of weeks left in the staking position.

For example:

* Alice locked 100 VERTO for 52 weeks; her staking position will unlock in 40 weeks. She has \`100 x 40 = 4000 vVERTO\`
* Bob locked 100 VERTO for 52 weeks; his staking position will unlock in 52 weeks. He has \`100 x 52 = 5200 vVERTO\`
* Carole locked 100 VERTO for ten weeks; and her staking position has ended. She has \`100 vVERTO\`
