# ðŸ—³ Voting

![](../../public/assets/voting-header.png)

Voting gives a voice to the VertoTrade community, letting the community have a say in how VertoTrade develops into the future.

Check out [VertoTrade's native voting portal](https://voting.vertotrade.finance/?\_gl=1\*pc8o0h\*\_ga\*MTUzNDEzNDQxMy4xNjAwNzkzNDM4\*\_ga\_334KNG3DMQ\*MTYwNDMwMTk4Ni42MC4xLjE2MDQzMDM3MDIuMA..#/) on the VertoTrade website.

**Core** - proposals posted by the VertoTrade team. The results will be actioned.

**Community** - proposals posted by the VertoTrade community. These are used to propose ideas and show the communities point of view. The VertoTrade team reviews every community vote and will often cherry-pick any great ideas and designs with strong community support up to the coming product releases and/or core voting proposal level.
