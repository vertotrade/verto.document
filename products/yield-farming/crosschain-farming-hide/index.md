With the multichain deployment, VertoTrade is now bringing the iconic yield farming experience from VertoTrade farms to users on other blockchains. Yield Farms allow users to earn VERTO while supporting VertoTrade by staking LP Tokens.

Check out the [main section](../) to learn more about yield farming.

Check out our [How to Use Farms guide](https://docs.vertotrade.com/products/yield-farming/how-to-use-farms) to get started with farming.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Yield farming can give better rewards than Pools, but it comes with a risk of **Impermanent Loss**. Itâ€™s not as scary as it sounds, but it is worth learning about the concept before you get started.

Check out this great [article about Impermanent Loss ](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained)from Binance Academy to learn more.
