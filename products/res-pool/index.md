## What’s “Flexible” staking?

You can simply stake your REBUS tokens to earn VERTO tokens or stake VERTO tokens to earn other assets in the platform. Flexible staking allows users to stake REBUS or VERTO and earn rewards with the ability to unstake whenever they please.

### Flexible Staking

Stake your REBUS or VERTO and forget about it! Rewards will be automatically distributed and included in your staking balance.

#### If you have VERTO staked you can

* Add more VERTO to flexible staking
* Harvest rewards any time
* Withdraw any time (fees apply for the first 72 hours, see below)

#### Unstaking fee

* **0.1% if you unstake (withdraw) within 72 hours.**
* Only applies within 3 days of manually staking.
* After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
* The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more tokens in the pool.
* This fee only applies to manual unstaking.

The VERTO collected via the unstaking fee is **burned every week** as part of the regular VERTO token burns.

This is a good thing for VERTO holders because it reduces the overall amount of VERTO tokens in existence, which helps reduce inflation.
