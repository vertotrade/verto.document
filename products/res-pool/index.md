# VERTO Res Pools

## Stake VERTO, earn VERTO!

VertoTrade now offers one VERTO Res Pools with two staking options: flexible staking or fixed-term staking.

![*Note that actual values will vary](/public/assets/stake-before-enable.png)

## What‚Äôs the difference between ‚ÄúFlexible‚Äù and ‚ÄúFixed-Term‚Äù staking?

With both, you can simply stake your VERTO tokens to earn more VERTO tokens with no deposit fees. Flexible staking allows users to stake VERTO and earn rewards with the ability to unstake whenever they please. Fixed-term staking allows users to maximise their yield and earn even more VERTO by locking their staked VERTO for a period of time they choose, earning a linearly boosted yield compared to flexible staking.

Flexible staking and fixed-term staking are both part of the same pool to allow users easy migration between the two staking options. However, when you do fixed-term staking, there is an option to perform flexible VERTO staking on the side.

### Flexible Staking

Stake your VERTO and forget about it! VERTO rewards will be automatically distributed and included in your staking balance, minus a small fee (same as the old Auto VERTO Res Pools).

#### If you have VERTO staked in flexible staking

* ‚úÖ Add more VERTO to flexible staking
* ‚úÖ Harvest rewards any time
* ‚úÖ Withdraw any time (fees apply for the first 72 hours, see below)
* ‚úÖ Convert all staked VERTO in flexible to fixed-term staking
* ‚ùå Add VERTO to fixed-term staking if you have any VERTO in flexible staking
* ‚ùå Convert part of the staked VERTO in flexible to fixed-term staking

#### Unstaking fee

* **0.1% if you unstake (withdraw) within 72 hours.**
* Only applies within 3 days of manually staking.
* After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
* The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more VERTO in the pool.
* This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

#### Performance fee

* **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
* For example, if the harvest were 1 VERTO, then 0.02 VERTO would be subtracted as the performance fee.

The VERTO collected via the unstaking fee and performance fee is **burned every week** as part of the regular VERTO token burns.

This is a good thing for VERTO holders because it reduces the overall amount of VERTO tokens in existence, which helps reduce inflation.

### Fixed-Term Staking

Stake your VERTO for a fixed amount of time to maximise yields and receive additional benefits! VERTO rewards will be locked along with the staked VERTO until the staking duration ends.

* No performance fees
* The longer you lock, the higher the boost applied to the yield! Always offering a higher yield compared to flexible staking!
* VERTO rewards will unlock, along with your staked VERTO, when your lock duration expires
* Once staked in fixed-term staking, you cannot withdraw until the end of your lock duration.
* üéÅ Enjoy benefits such as:
  * üöú Boosted farm yields: [bVERTO](../../yield-farming/bcake/)
  * ‚ú® Priority access or special events
  * and so much more in our ongoing multichain expansion!

#### If you have VERTO locked in fixed-term staking

* ‚úÖ Add more VERTO to lock
* ‚úÖ Extend the lock period
* ‚úÖ Perform flexible staking on the side
* ‚ùå Harvest rewards
* ‚ùå Withdraw before the lock ends
