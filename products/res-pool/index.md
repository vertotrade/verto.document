## What’s “Flexible” staking?

You can simply stake your REBUS tokens to earn VERTO tokens or stake VERTO tokens to earn LUDUS and AUREUS with no deposit fees. Flexible staking allows users to stake REBUS or VERTO and earn rewards with the ability to unstake whenever they please.

### Flexible Staking

Stake your REBUS or VERTO and forget about it! VERTO rewards will be automatically distributed and included in your staking balance, minus a small fee.

#### If you have VERTO staked you can

* Add more VERTO to flexible staking
* Harvest rewards any time
* Withdraw any time (fees apply for the first 72 hours, see below)

#### Unstaking fee

* **0.1% if you unstake (withdraw) within 72 hours.**
* Only applies within 3 days of manually staking.
* After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
* The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more tokens in the pool.
* This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

#### Performance fee

* **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
* For example, if the harvest were 1 VERTO, then 0.02 VERTO would be subtracted as the performance fee.

The VERTO collected via the unstaking fee and performance fee is **burned every week** as part of the regular VERTO token burns.

This is a good thing for VERTO holders because it reduces the overall amount of VERTO tokens in existence, which helps reduce inflation.
