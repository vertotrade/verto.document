<figure><img src="../../../public/assets/Smart Router.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

VertoTrade Smart Router is a routing algorithm that links the AMM and stableswap to provide better liquidity and pricing. It uses a smart order routing algorithm that executes trades across multiple pools to find the best price for traders. For more information on StableSwap [click here](../../stableswap/).

The Kitchen will gradually roll out StableSwap pairs to further test and improve the product.

## Why should I use the Smart Router for my AMM swaps?&#x20;

* Swap your stablecoins or other pairs with similar asset prices more efficiently with the same trade steps.&#x20;
* With the StableSwap function, the trading slippage is lower than normal AMM.
* The StableSwap trading fees are lower compared to the normal AMM.

## Still Cooking&#x20;

* Better UI on output.
* Split routes for more efficient trades. Eg. Router sends 50% of pair to a different route to save fees depending on the trade size and liquidity.&#x20;
* Include MM-linked pools for route calculation.
