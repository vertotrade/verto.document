# Liquidity Pools

When you add your token to a Liquidity Pool you will receive Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens and share in the fees.

## LP Tokens

As an example, if you deposited **VERTO** and **REBUS** into a Liquidity Pool, you'd receive **VERTO-REBUS LP** tokens.

The number of LP tokens you receive represents your portion of the VERTO-REBUS Liquidity Pool.

You can also redeem your funds at any time by removing your liquidity.

## Liquidity Providers earn trading fees

Providing liquidity gives you a reward in the form of trading fees when people use your liquidity pool.

Whenever someone trades on VertoTrade, the trader pays a 0.25% fee, **of which 0.17%** is added to the Liquidity Pool of the swap pair they traded on.

For example:

* There are 10 LP tokens representing 10 VERTO and 10 REBUS tokens.
* 1 LP token = 1 VERTO + 1 REBUS
* Someone trades 10 VERTO for 10 REBUS.
* Someone else trades 10 REBUS for 10 VERTO.
* The VERTO/REBUS liquidity pool now has 10.017 VERTO and 10.017 REBUS.
* Each LP token is now worth 1.00017 VERTO + 1.00017 REBUS.

To make being a liquidity provider even more worth your while, you can also put your LP tokens to work whipping up some fresh yield on the [VERTO Farms](https://vertotrade.com/farms), while still earning your 0.17% trading fee reward.

## Impermanent Loss

Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss.

[“Simply put, impermanent loss is the difference between holding tokens in an AMM and holding them in your wallet.” - Nate Hindman](https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22)
