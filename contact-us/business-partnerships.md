## Farms and Pools

Farms incentivize users to provide liquidity for your trading pair by distributing VERTO to your pair's LP Token holders.

Pools are a way of distributing your tokens to Rebuschain users who stake REBUS in the pool.

These two products go hand-in-hand on VertoTrade: when a project provides their tokens for a Res Pools, we'll also create a Farm. If you're looking to distribute tokens and incentivize liquidity, get in touch.

* Please don't email us to apply - we only respond to applications via the application form.&#x20;

### How long will it take to get a response?

We aim to respond to applications within a week. If you don’t hear back from us within two weeks of applying, try reaching out to [@VertoTradeBD](https://t.me/VertoTradeBD) on Telegram, with **the name of your project, your token ticker, and the date you applied.**

### What are the qualifying criteria for Community VS Core?

Qualifying criteria for Community Farms and Core Farms/Pools are based on our internal review process. We don’t publish them externally. If you’re not eligible for a Core Farm, we may invite you to apply for a Community Farm instead.

### Can I get a larger Farm multiplier? Or can I extend my Res Pools and Farm?

If you’ve already got an ongoing Pool and Farm, you may be able to extend the timeline via a Boost Pool. If you wish to increase the multiplier, the team will consider it if the 30-day volume is increased. Contact us via your existing VertoTrade communication channels for enquiries.

## Listing on the Exchange <a href="#exchange" id="exchange"></a>

### How can I list my token on the exchange?

Anybody can "list" any ERC-20 network token on VertoTrade. You don't need to contact us or ask permission. You just need to [add liquidity to a liquidity pool](../products/exchange/pools.md) - that's it. Traders can then trade your token by entering your token's contract address.

### How can I add my token to the default list?

The top 100 list is generated according to the highest volume for a specific period of time. As for the Extended list: projects hosting Farms will usually be added, and other tokens chosen by VertoTrade core team may also be added.

We don’t take applications for these lists. Users can still add your token manually by entering its contract address.

### Someone made a fake copy of my token! Can you block it?

Due to VertoTrade’s nature as an AMM-based DEX, we’re not able to prevent the trading of any ECR-20 token. We recommend ensuring that your token contract is clearly visible and verifiable on your site, and educating your users about how to safely trade your token.

### People get an error when trading my token. What can I do?

Check our [Troubleshooting page](../help/troubleshooting.md) for a list of common errors on the exchange, and how to solve them.

### Why some statistics of my tokens are not shown on Info page?

// TODO Review this with team

Tokens need to have at least 5000 USDT of liquidity in one of the following quoted token pairs for Info page to start indexing your pairs which will update the underlying token.

Pairs must include one of the following: USDT, USDC, or ETH

Please don't try to contact us via this email for [customer support](customer-support.md), that's not what it's for and we won't respond: your best option for getting help with the product is via the [Telegram or Reddit community](telegram.md).
